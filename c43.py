'''
The first part of the DSA algorithm is the public key and private key generation, which can be described as:

Choose a prime number q, which is called the prime divisor.
Choose another primer number p, such that p-1 mod q = 0. p is called the prime modulus.
Choose an integer g, such that 1 < g < p, g**q mod p = 1 and g = h**((pâ€“1)/q) mod p. q is also called g's multiplicative order modulo p.
Choose an integer, such that 0 < x < q.
Compute y as g**x mod p.
Package the public key as {p,q,g,y}.
Package the private key as {p,q,g,x}.
The second part of the DSA algorithm is the signature generation and signature verification, which can be described as:

To generate a message signature, the sender can follow these steps:

Generate the message digest h, using a hash algorithm like SHA1.
Generate a random number k, such that 0 < k < q.
Compute r as (g**k mod p) mod q. If r = 0, select a different k.
Compute i, such that k*i mod q = 1. i is called the modular multiplicative inverse of k modulo q.
Compute s = i*(h+r*x) mod q. If s = 0, select a different k.
Package the digital signature as {r,s}.
To verify a message signature, the receiver of the message and the digital signature can follow these steps:

Generate the message digest h, using the same hash algorithm.
Compute w, such that s*w mod q = 1. w is called the modular multiplicative inverse of s modulo q.
Compute u1 = h*w mod q.
Compute u2 = r*w mod q.
Compute v = (((g**u1)*(y**u2)) mod p) mod q.
If v == r, the digital signature is valid.

DSA key recovery from nonce
Step 1: Relocate so that you are out of easy travel 
distance of us.

Step 2: Implement DSA, up to signing and verifying, 
including parameter generation.

Hah-hah you're too far away to come punch us.

Just kidding you can skip the parameter generation part 
if you want; if you do, use these params:

("But I want smaller params!" Then generate them yourself.)

The DSA signing operation generates a random subkey "k". 
You know this because you implemented the DSA sign operation.

This is the first and easier of two challenges regarding 
the DSA "k" subkey.

Given a known "k", it's trivial to recover the DSA 
private key "x":

          (s * k) - H(msg)
      x = ----------------  mod q
                  r
Do this a couple times to prove to yourself that you grok it. 
Capture it in a function of some sort.

Now then. I used the parameters above. I generated a keypair. 
My pubkey is:

  y = 84ad4719d044495496a3201c8ff484feb45b962e7302e56a392aee4

For those that envy a MC it can be hazardous to your health
So be friendly, a matter of life and death, just like a etch-a-sketch
(My SHA1 for this string was d2d0714f014a9784047eaeccf956520045c45265; 
I don't know what NIST wants you to do, but when I convert that hash to 
an integer I get: 0xd2d0714f014a9784047eaeccf956520045c45265).

I get:

  r = 548099063082341131477253921760299949438196259240
  s = 857042759984254168557880549501802188789837994940
I signed this string with a broken implemention of DSA that 
generated "k" values between 0 and 2^16. What's my private key?

Its SHA-1 fingerprint (after being converted to hex) is:

0954edd5e0afe5542a4adf012611a91912a3ec16
Obviously, it also generates the same signature for that string.
